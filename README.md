## Project Overview

Digital art is becoming increasingly popular, and there is a growing demand for online platforms where art can be bought and sold. The purpose of this project is to develop a website that provides such a platform, where art listers can list their digital art pieces for sale, and users can bid on them. 
One of the unique features of this website is the ability for users to create their own digital art using a neural network model from TensorFlow. This feature allows users to upload a normal photo and apply different styles to it, resulting in a unique piece of digital art. 
The website's design is modern and minimalistic, with a focus on functionality and ease of use. The website's interface is intuitive, allowing users to navigate easily and find what they are looking for quickly. The website is also designed to be mobile-friendly, making it accessible to users on a variety of devices.
Overall, the website provides a platform for digital art enthusiasts to discover, bid on, and create unique pieces of digital art. The website aims to promote the value of digital art as a form of creative expression, and make it accessible to a wider audience. By providing a user-friendly and innovative platform, the website aims to become a leading online marketplace for digital art.


## Purpose
The purpose of the website is to provide a platform for digital art enthusiasts to buy, sell, and create unique pieces of digital art. The website aims to create a community of artists and art lovers, and democratize the process of buying and selling digital art. By providing a user-friendly interface for both art listers and bidders, the website makes it easier for people to discover and bid on unique pieces of digital art.
